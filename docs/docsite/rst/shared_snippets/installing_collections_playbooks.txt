You can install collections locally next to your playbooks inside your project instead of in a global location on your system or on your AWX.
This approach has these added benefits:
* Ensures that all users of the project use the same collection version.
* Using self-contained projects makes it easy to move across different environments. Increased portability also reduces overhead when setting up new environments. This is a benefit when deploying Ansible playbooks in cloud environments.
* Managing colelctions locally lets you version them along with your playbooks.
* Installing collections locally isolates them from global installations in environments that have multiple projects.

Here is an example of keeping a collection adjacent to the current playbook, under a ``collections/ansible_collections/`` directory structure.

.. code-block:: text

    ./
    ├── play.yml
    ├── collections/
    │   └── ansible_collections/
    │               └── my_namespace/
    │                   └── my_collection/<collection structure lives here>


See :ref:`collection_structure` for details on the collection directory structure.
